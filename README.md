# Watsonville-Environmental-Science-Workshop-Survey-Visualizer
This project was created for the Watsonville Environmental Science Workshop to better visualize their exit survey results without needing experience in data analysis. 

This repo contains the source code for the deployed streamlit app that accepts a CSV file with a timestamp and generates tabulated visuals for each feature over a time frame.
